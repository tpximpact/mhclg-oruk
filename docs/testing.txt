TESTING

Per Next.js best practice as of August 2024 when the project commenced, we have chosen end to end (E2E) testing as our quality assurance mechanism.

To the best of our abilities we believe that we have 100% page coverage for E2E testing. These tests can be run using 'yarn e2e'.

A suite of E2E tests - using Playwright https://playwright.dev - is provided in /src/e2e, providing tests for

- the validator
- the dashboard and directory
- all content pages (plus any additional pages added in dynamic sections)

Note that the dashboard and directory tests do not presently test sorting functionality.

Work not core to the original brief does not have detailed testing for sub-page level interactivity in place and this again coild usefullt be added, for instance to test the schema and api page version switching.

UNIT TESTS

At project commencement, reliable unit testing of server side components was immature, hence the decision above. We provide no unit tests at present and this would be a very strong target candidate for future consolidation work. In particular, unit test coverage for /src/utilities would be highly desirable.

The whole testing picture and the available technology and best practice has evolved considerably since we scoped the project, and this is in general an area which would benefit from revisiting should additional time and budget become available.

STORYBOOK

We provide a partial storybook of visual component tests. This was descoped during development but the tests remain current and accurate and are still useful. Storybook coverage coild usefully be extended to more components and could in future leverage eg Chromatic.
