The legacy ORUK website was distrubuted accross several platforms, and hence made extensive use of subdomains.

The new site brings most of this functionality together under a single project, but it is desirable that the legacy subdomains continue to be supported for compatibilty with, e.g. existing bookmarks, links etc.

This could be achieved in several ways - perhaps the easiest might be to redirect those subdomains to paths on the new site.

Current Vercel docs for this csn be found at https://vercel.com/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain

The domains are

https://openreferraluk.org -> should update A record to point to vercel IP (presumably?)

https://developers.openreferraluk.org -> /developers

https://validator.openreferraluk.org -> /developers/validator

https://docs.openreferraluk.org -> developers/specifications (this one isn's as clear cut as the others. could equally point at developers/api)

https://forum.openreferral.org -> NO CHANGE

https://exporter.openreferraluk.org -> this tool has been removed. Best behaviour would be to redirect to / but perhaps with a 410?

https://tools.openreferraluk.org -> this is 404 at the moment. perhaps should redirect to /developers
