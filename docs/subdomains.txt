The legacy ORUK website was distrubuted accross several platforms, and hence made extensive use of subdomains.

The new site brings most of this functionality together under a single project, but it is desirable that the legacy subdomains continue to be supported for compatibilty with, e.g. existing bookmarks, links etc.

We have impleemted this by using a wildcard rule in Vercel to direct *.openreferraluk.org to our site plus a Next.js middleware which catches the followimg legacy subdomains

https://developers.openreferraluk.org -> /developers

https://validator.openreferraluk.org -> /developers/validator

https://docs.openreferraluk.org -> developers/api

https://forum.openreferraluk.org -> forum.openreferral.org

taxonomy.openreferraluk.org -> /developers/overview

schema.openreferraluk.org -> /developers/schemata

The following legacy subdomains have been retired

https://exporter.openreferraluk.org -> this tool has been removed
https://tools.openreferraluk.org -> was already 404
