# Project Initiation Document

## Introduction

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) is supporting councils to adopt the Open Referral UK (ORUK) data standard. 

ORUK is the project name for UK use of the international data standard Human Services Data Standard(HSDS). Essentially this is the data fields used to describe the details about a local service to support people e.g. the name, description, venue, start time etc. A service could be a public sector service or a community service e.g. foodbank, benefit assessment.

This initiative aims to improve efficiency with partners, enhance data accuracy and completeness, enable sustainable cost models, and facilitate data sharing across boundaries to better serve residents in various contexts.

This document is designed for programme and project managers leading the implementation of Open Referral UK within a council area. The project scope should include collaboration with external partners, which is briefly addressed on the next page.

We assume the business case has been agreed in principle and a project mandate submitted. While each council may approach this project differently, the headings in this document reflect standard elements of a PID. Rather than providing exhaustive project details, the document focuses on key considerations and ideas, offering a concise yet supportive framework to help councils create their own PID for implementing Open Referral UK.

## 1. Project overview


**Title**: ORUK data standard adoption project 


**Purpose**: To implement the Open Referral (ORUK) data standard, streamlining local service information and enabling better outcomes for residents and service users.

## 2. Vision


Create a single, accurate source of truth for local support services, accessible across all tools and pathways, to empower residents, families and frontline workers with the right information when they need it. This will ensure people get the help they need, reducing reliance on the public sector and breaking down outdated silos.


Achieving this vision will require strong leadership and robust digital resources. A phased approach is recommended, starting with areas already gaining momentum, such as Adult Social Care, SEND Local Offer, and Family Information Services/Hubs. Over time, this can expand to address other critical local issues, including homelessness, foodbanks, the cost-of-living crisis, bereavement, autism assessments, or any other priorities identified locally.
## 3. Objectives


* Demonstrate that data can be collected more easily and efficiently by multiple sources.
* Ensure the collected data is accurate, reliable, and trusted.
* Enable partner organisations to effectively reuse the data.
* Gather insights and lessons to inform scaling across the full council geographical area.

### 3.1 Digital Declaration
More than 200 councils have signed up to the Local Digital Declaration, reflecting a shared commitment to improving flexibility and interoperability of software systems across the public and third sectors.
Open Referral UK defines the data and interfaces needed for tools that help people find services and analyse service provision, ensuring these tools can seamlessly communicate with each other.


## 4. Scope
The ultimate intention is to implement the ORUK model across the entire council area, overcoming partner administrative boundaries. However, this project will begin on a smaller scale to refine the approach, gather evidence, and strengthen the business case for broader adoption in the future.
** Scope overview:**
This project will focus on proving the concept, but will include partners outside of the council itself. While more could be included, the scope has been defined to meet realistic timelines and will be refined after a discovery exercise.

**In scope:**
* Collecting and validating data from at least one external partner organisation
* Data collection and assurance focused on the three required by a council i.e. Adult Social Care, SEND/Local Offer, and Family Hubs or a particular context e.g. cost of living crisis, ho 
* Developing a service type taxonomy
* Building a digital infrastructure for data sharing via API
* Ensuring at least three partner organisations consume the data
* Producing a management report with service numbers, types, and geographic grouping

**Out of scope:**
* Alternative technical methods for data collection and consumption
* Additional partners collecting or using data
* Development of other taxonomies

## 5. Stakeholders
While the Transformation/Digital team is expected to be involved in implementing this project, this may not always be the case. Therefore, they are listed below, along with other key stakeholders who should be kept informed through highlight reports, deliverables, and invitations to data demos. Some may also have roles in governance.
* Director of Public Health. Focused on reducing health inequalities and improving overall health
* Director of Adult Social Care. Needs accessible service information to provide residents with information and advice relating to care and support for adults and support for carers
* Director of Childrenâ€™s Care. Aims to make SEND and Family Hubs information widely available across websites, tools, and neighbouring areas
* Health & Wellbeing Board. Seeks comprehensive data on services available to improve health and wellbeing across the area
* Commissioners. Need data on local service demand and availability to identify gaps and prevent reliance on statutory services.
* Transformation / Digital Leader. Would be able to help with new process and digital infrastructure
* Chief Executive of local infrastructure organisation. Interested in engaging infrastructure organisations for data collection, ensuring free reuse of service data for the third sector
* Finance Director. Aims to reduce current costs for service data collection and establish a sustainable cost-sharing model. Seeking sayings from reduced enquiries as people self-serve preventing the need for formal support
* Third sector organisations. Seek efficient promotion of services through well-organised data sharing
