# Project Initiation Document

## Introduction

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) is supporting councils to adopt the Open Referral UK (ORUK) data standard. 

ORUK is the project name for UK use of the international data standard Human Services Data Standard(HSDS). Essentially this is the data fields used to describe the details about a local service to support people e.g. the name, description, venue, start time etc. A service could be a public sector service or a community service e.g. foodbank, benefit assessment.

This initiative aims to improve efficiency with partners, enhance data accuracy and completeness, enable sustainable cost models, and facilitate data sharing across boundaries to better serve residents in various contexts.

This document is designed for programme and project managers leading the implementation of Open Referral UK within a council area. The project scope should include collaboration with external partners, which is briefly addressed on the next page.

We assume the business case has been agreed in principle and a project mandate submitted. While each council may approach this project differently, the headings in this document reflect standard elements of a PID. Rather than providing exhaustive project details, the document focuses on key considerations and ideas, offering a concise yet supportive framework to help councils create their own PID for implementing Open Referral UK.
