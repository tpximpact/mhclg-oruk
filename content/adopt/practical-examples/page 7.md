# Use combined datasets to plan and commission services 

Use standardised data to see how services are used to make evidence-driven decisions.

# Description

Standardised data on services with universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each service, as mandated by ORUK, makes it easier to log:
- demand for services
- service take-up
- service referrals to address vulnerabilities
- service denials because of over-capacity

When merged and analysed with other data, this can be used to inform service planning, commissioning and referrals. 

Longer term, these statistics can be cross-referenced with metrics in an area to assess the impact of services and re-assign budgets accordingly. 

# Examples

- SAVVI circular model for service improvement to address vulnerabilities
- For example, households assessed as threatened with homelessness.
