# Description

Use an aggregator to combine data from multiple publishers, such as local authorities, so it can be reused on a larger scale. 

Maintaining one dataset avoids duplication in each local area, and helps you see a comprehensive list of available services. 

For example, a central government Family Services directory could integrate relevant services from different counties and councils into one feed, that can be reused. 

This method can also be applied regionally. For example, all councils within a combined authority, or all organisations within an Integrated Care Board (ICB) area.

# Examples

DWP and work-readiness servicesThe Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) can pull local work-readiness service data from councils, supporting policy and referrals.

DfE and Family HubsThe Department for Education (DfE) can use data that already exists in local authorities to improve Family Hubs services (.pdf).

Lancashire and South Cumbria ICBThey are merging services data from councils, health and community organisations (.pdf) to create a reliable dataset of services, enable data reuse and see service gaps.
