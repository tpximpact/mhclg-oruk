## Description

Having compliant data allows for tools to be created to automate quality checks, updates and highlight issues to data stewards.

Automated checks could include:
- Reminding service owners to verify the data and fill any missing information
- Removing any duplicate entries
- Checking when data was last updated to ensure it is current
- Identifying which extra fields are populated to enhance the data (such as costs, schedules, languages)
- Ensuring data feeds are live and comply with ORUK standards
- Employing machine learning and web scraping technologies to spot discrepancies and changes in the data
