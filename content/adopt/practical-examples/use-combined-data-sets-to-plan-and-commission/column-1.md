## Description

Standardised data on services with universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each service, as mandated by ORUK, makes it easier to log:
- demand for services
- service take-up
- service referrals to address vulnerabilities
- service denials because of over-capacity

When merged and analysed with other data, this can be used to inform service planning, commissioning and referrals. 

Longer term, these statistics can be cross-referenced with metrics in an area to assess the impact of services and re-assign budgets accordingly. 

## Examples

- [SAVVI circular model](https://images.app.goo.gl/zwpWQ27nUaxgyJoz9) for service improvement to address vulnerabilities
- For example, [households assessed as threatened with homelessness](https://webservices.esd.org.uk/data.html?metricType=14486&area=AllLaInCountry_England&period=latest%3A5&rowGrouping=area&ApplicationKey=FXePiAAPgtzzXOkWbzNgQWAyRIrfaMYJcxDiPttj&Signature=mSLuy3aOcd9y6RY1MTUCAbrUm/c=).
