# Description

Give professionals, such as link workers, the information they need in a format they can easily access so they can match clients with services that meet their needs.

Typically, a professional will enter information remotely, such as:
- Age (or age range)
- Location
- Needs
- Circumstances

This information can be used to search, filter and match people with the right local support, within the tools they already use every day. It makes the process of finding and using essential service data much easier and more efficient.
