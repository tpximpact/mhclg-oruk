# How to get started

A step by step guide to adopting the ORUK standard.

# Adopting ORUK: step by step 

- Read a [summary of the ORUK data standards](/about/10-introducing)
- Explore our [catalogue of use cases](/case-studies) to see how ORUK improves efficiency and targeting services
- Present the [executive summary](/adopt/01_summary) to your senior leadership team to secure their support
- Use our [business case guidance](/adopt/01_summary), [project initiation document](/adopt/03_pid) template, and [benefits calculator](/adopt/04_benefits_calculator) to develop a compelling case for adoption within your organisation
- Follow our [technical guidance to implement an ORUK API feed](/adopt/04_benefits_calculator), either with your own development team or by using a compliant product
- Check your API feed(s) [using our validator](/developers/validator). Once they pass, we will add them to our [verified feed directory](/community/directory)
- Publicise your feed(s) directly and through our channels to encourage data reuse and innovation
