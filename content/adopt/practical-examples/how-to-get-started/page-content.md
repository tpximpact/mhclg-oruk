# Adopting ORUK: step by step 

- Read a summary of the ORUK data standards

- Present the executive summary to your senior leadership team to secure their support
- Use our business case guidance, project initiation document template, and benefits calculator to develop a compelling case for adoption within your organisation
- Follow our technical guidance to implement an ORUK API feed, either with your own development team or by using a compliant product
