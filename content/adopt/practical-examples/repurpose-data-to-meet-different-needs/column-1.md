## Description

The same data can be reused in many places, making your service information more flexible and powerful. You can consume a single API feed of services and apply filters to create audience-specific views.

This means audiences see the services relevant to them, presented in a format they can use, while the underlying data comes from one, consistent source.

For example, the same data that powers your directory website could seamlessly integrate with a user’s voice assistant like Siri or Alexa. This not only makes services accessible to more people, but adapts to their preferred method of finding information. 

This application can become smarter over time. By integrating with AI, it can learn from past queries and user feedback. This learning capability helps the system refine and give better answers, improving the user experience over time.
