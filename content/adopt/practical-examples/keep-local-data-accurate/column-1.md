# Description

Organisations with data used in multiple locations, such as charities or government departments, can publish a single feed of data in an ORUK format. 

This data can then be accessed and used to update local databases or used as a live reference.

# Examples

## Ofsted
Ofsted's open, ORUK-compliant feed provides school data directly to local councils, automating updates and eliminating manual data entry for current school lists. 

## CQC
The CQC's open, ORUK-compliant feed for care provider data ensures local directories have accurate, up-to-date information, benefiting services and citizens with minimal effort. 

## Age UK
National charities like Age UK publish ORUK-compliant service directories, enabling local reuse. This saves time and provides citizens with current charity service information.
