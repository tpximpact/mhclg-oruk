## About 

Manually collecting and maintaining service data for an entire region or country is a huge and often duplicated effort. This approach uses an aggregator to combine data from multiple publishers (like local authorities and councils) into one central, reusable dataset. 

This means a service is only recorded once, making it easier to maintain and keep consistency across all platforms.

By combining this data, you get a clearer, more complete overview of the service landscape. This helps you identify service gaps so you can make informed decisions about where new services are most needed.

For example, a national directory for Family Services could pull relevant information from different counties and councils into a single feed that can be used by anyone. The same method works for regions, such as all councils within a combined authority, or organisations within the area served by an Integrated Care Board (ICB).

## Examples

**DfE and Family Hubs**   
The Department for Education (DfE) can [use existing data from local authorities to improve and expand its national Family Hubs services (.pdf)](/steering/ORUK%20Steering%20Group%2002%20-%20Annex%20A%20-%20DfE%20Family%20Hubs%20presentation.pdf). 

**Lancashire and South Cumbria ICB**  
They are [merging services data from multiple councils, health providers and community organisations](/steering/ORUK%20Steering%20Group%2002%20-%20Annex%20B%20-%20Lancs%20and%20South%20Cumbria%20health%20and%20care%20%20presentation.pdf) (.pdf) to create a single, reliable dataset for the entire region. This enables data reuse across different organisations and provides an overview of service availability, helping them identify and address service gaps.

**Canada's federated datasets**  
In this large-scale example, a Canadian province combines numerous federated datasets into a single, comprehensive record. This process removes duplicates and standardises data, making it easier to share, analyse, and reuse the information across the entire province.
