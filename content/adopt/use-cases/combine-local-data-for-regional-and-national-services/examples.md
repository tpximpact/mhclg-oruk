[CQC - national data for local directories](https://openreferraluk.org/developers/dashboard/67d1781a96f61f8df112a03f)<br/>
The CQC's open, ORUK-compliant feed for care provider data means local directories have accurate, up-to-date information, benefiting services and citizens with minimal effort.Â 

**How this could be used in education**<br/>
By providing an open, ORUK-compliant feed, organisations like Ofsted could give local councils direct access to school data. Automated updates would eliminate the need for manual data entry to maintain current school lists.

**How this could be used in charities**<br/>
National charities could publish ORUK-compliant service directories, enabling local teams to easily reuse this information. This saves time and ensures citizens have the most current information about available charity services
