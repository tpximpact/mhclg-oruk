## About 

Manually collecting and maintaining service data for an entire region or country is a huge and often duplicated effort. This approach uses an aggregator to combine data from multiple publishers (like local authorities and councils) into one central, reusable dataset. 

This means a service is only recorded once, making it easier to maintain and keep consistency across all platforms.

By combining this data, you get a clearer, more complete overview of the service landscape. This helps you identify service gaps so you can make informed decisions about where new services are most needed.

For example, a national directory for Family Services could pull relevant information from different counties and councils into a single feed that can be used by anyone. The same method works for regions, such as all councils within a combined authority, or organisations within the area served by an Integrated Care Board (ICB).
