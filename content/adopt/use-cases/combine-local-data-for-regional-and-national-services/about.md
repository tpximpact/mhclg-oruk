## About 

Use an aggregator to combine data from multiple publishers, such as local authorities, so it can be reused on a larger scale. 

Maintaining one dataset avoids duplication in each local area, and helps you see a comprehensive list of available services. 

For example, a central government Family Services directory could integrate relevant services from different counties and councils into one feed, that can be reused. 

This method can also be applied regionally. For example, all councils within a combined authority, or all organisations within an Integrated Care Board (ICB) area.
