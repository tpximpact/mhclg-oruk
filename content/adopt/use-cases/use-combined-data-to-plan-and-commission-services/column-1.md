## About

Traditional data collection makes it hard to link a service to its actual impact. By using standardised data with unique identifiers for each service, you can systematically track and analyse key metrics, such as:

* **Service demand** \- how many people are looking for a service  
* **Take-up** \- how many people actually use it  
* **Referrals** \- what services address specific vulnerabilities  
* **Denials** \- why people are turned away from services

When this service data is combined with other metrics in an area, it provides a powerful view of what's working and what isn't. This allows commissioners to make smarter decisions about service planning, commissioning, and funding.

Longer term, you can use these insights to assess the impact of services and allocate budgets accordingly.

## Examples

[**SAVVI circular model for service improvement**](https://coda.io/@savvi/welcome/the-savvi-process-192)  
The SAVVI model uses standardised data to move from identifying a vulnerability to providing and improving services.

### **NHS Waiting Well** By embedding service data into NHS patient journeys, professionals can provide proactive support to patients on waiting lists, helping them manage their condition while they wait. Over time we can assess which services are most effective.
