## About

Recording national services, like charities or government departments, in every local database is a duplicated effort that can lead to outdated information. 

By having organisations publish a single, accurate feed of their data in an ORUK format, local authorities can access this feed to update their own databases or use it as a live reference.

This approach saves effort, as local staff no longer need to manually input or verify data that's already maintained at the source. It also reduces errors by making sure information is always sourced from a single, reliable feed. 

Ultimately, this helps build public trust in the accuracy of the information and the services they rely on.
