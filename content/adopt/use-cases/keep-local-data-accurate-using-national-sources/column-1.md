## About

Recording national services, like charities or government departments, in every local database is a duplicated effort that can lead to outdated information. 

By having organisations publish a single, accurate feed of their data in an ORUK format, local authorities can access this feed to update their own databases or use it as a live reference.

This approach saves effort, as local staff no longer need to manually input or verify data that's already maintained at the source. It also reduces errors by making sure information is always sourced from a single, reliable feed. 

Ultimately, this helps build public trust in the accuracy of the information and the services they rely on.

## Examples

[**CQC \- national data for local directories**](/developers/dashboard/67d1781a96f61f8df112a03f)  
The CQC's open API feed for care provider data transformed to the ORUK structure means local directories have accurate, up-to-date information, benefiting services and citizens with minimal effort. 

**How this could be used in education**  
*By providing an open, ORUK-compliant feed, organisations like Ofsted could give local councils direct access to school data. Automated updates would eliminate the need for manual data entry to maintain current school lists.*

**How this could be used in charities**  
*National charities, ~~like Age UK~~ could publish ORUK-compliant service directories, enabling local teams to easily reuse this information. This saves time and ensures citizens have the most current information about available charity services.*
