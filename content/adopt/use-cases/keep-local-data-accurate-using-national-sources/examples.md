[**CQC \- national data for local directories**](/developers/dashboard/67d1781a96f61f8df112a03f)  
The CQC's open API feed for care provider data transformed to the ORUK structure means local directories have accurate, up-to-date information, benefiting services and citizens with minimal effort. 

**How this could be used in education**  
*By providing an open, ORUK-compliant feed, organisations like Ofsted could give local councils direct access to school data. Automated updates would eliminate the need for manual data entry to maintain current school lists.*

**How this could be used in charities**  
*National charities, ~~like Age UK~~ could publish ORUK-compliant service directories, enabling local teams to easily reuse this information. This saves time and ensures citizens have the most current information about available charity services.*
