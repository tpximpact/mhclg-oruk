## About

For professionals such as link workers, finding accurate and timely support for their clients is crucial. 

By providing a single, up-to-date data source, you can present services in a way that helps link workers easily find the information they need within the tools they already use. 

This makes matching clients to community-based support more efficient by enabling professionals to search, filter, and match services based on criteria such as:

- Age
- Location
- Needs
- Circumstances
