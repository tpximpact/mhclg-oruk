## About 

For professionals such as link workers, finding accurate and timely support for their clients is crucial. 

By providing a single, up-to-date data source, you can present services in a way that helps link workers easily find the information they need within the tools they already use. 

This makes matching clients to community-based support more efficient by enabling professionals to search, filter, and match services based on criteria such as:

* Age  
* Location  
* Needs  
* Circumstances

## Examples

[**WellAware and professional tools**](https://www.wellaware.org.uk/)  
Bristolâ€™s WellAware uses the Open Referral UK standard to power its service directory with data that can be consumed by professional-facing tools. 

### **How this could be used at food banks** A volunteer at a food bank can use a reliable data stream to find and refer individuals to community support. This data can also be used for regular checks to flag vulnerable areas and offer extra services to those communities.

### **How this could be used for households threatened with homelessness** Professionals working with households threatened with homelessness or eviction can instantly find and refer clients to relevant support, like legal advice or financial counselling. Regular data checks can make sure support is available in at-risk areas.
