## About

Think of it as a single source for all your service information. From this one source, you can automatically create custom views for different audiences. This approach makes your service information more flexible and powerful. 

It makes sure people see the services most relevant to them, in the format they prefer, while the data remains consistent and accurate everywhere.

For example, the same data that powers your directory website can be used by a user’s voice assistant like Siri or Alexa. This not only makes services accessible to more people but adapts to their preferred way of finding information. 

Over time, this application can become smarter by using AI and machine learning to learn from past queries, refining its answers and improving the user experience for everyone.

## Examples
