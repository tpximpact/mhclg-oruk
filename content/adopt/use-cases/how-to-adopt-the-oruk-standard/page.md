# How to adopt the ORUK standard

## A quick guide to adopting the Open Referral UK data standard

1. Understand the standards - read a [summary of the ORUK data standard](
/about/10-introducing) to understand the core principles and how they can benefit your organisation
2. [Explore use cases](/adopt/use-cases) - see how other organisations have used ORUK to improve efficiency and better target services
3. Secure support from your senior leadership - use the [executive summary](/adopt/01_summary) to present the benefits to key decision-makers
4. Develop a business case - use our [business case guidance](/adopt/02_business_case), [project initiation document](/adopt/03_pid) template, and [benefits calculator](/adopt/04_benefits_calculator) to build a strong case for adoption
5. Implement the technical solution. Follow our [technical guidance to implement your ORUK API feed](/developers/overview). You can do this with your own development team or by using a compliant product
6. Validate your data - use our free [service validator tool](/developers/validator) to check that your data feed meets the ORUK standard
7. Go live - once validated, we will add your data feed to our [verified directory](/community/directory). We'll also help you publicise your feed to encourage data reuse and innovation


ORUK is an interchange standard that makes sure people sending and receiving data understand it in a clear, consistent way. To make this happen, data is transferred via an API feed using the ORUK standard as a common 'language' for computer systems to automatically share and keep service information accurate and up-to-date.Â
