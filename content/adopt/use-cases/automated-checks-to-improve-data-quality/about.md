## About

Manual checks can be slow, unreliable, and lead to outdated or incorrect service information. By using compliant data, you can build automated tools that continuously check for issues, verify updates, and notify data owners.

This makes the information people rely on to find services more accurate and reliable.

These automated checks can:
* Remind service owners to verify and complete their information
* Remove duplicate entries to keep your data clean
* Check for recent updates to make sure all information is current
* Identify extra fields that have been populated that enhance the data (such as costs, schedules, languages)
* Monitor live feeds to make sure they comply with ORUK standards
* Use machine learning to automatically spot discrepancies and changes in the data
