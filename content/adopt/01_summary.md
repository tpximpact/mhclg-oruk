# Executive summary

Giving citizens access to the services they need, no matter where they first seek help.

*“Lots of people in the council have been crying out for a system like this, and there it is, virtually fully formed and ready to use on a plate. It will revolutionise how social care functions as a mediator between people in need and the community support on their doorstep.”*

## Summary
Adopting ORUK means your council can consolidate and streamline the maintainence of community services information across sectors and partners. It creates reliable, accessible information that could reduce the strain on public services by empowering citizens to find support themselves. ORUK is a data standard that will mean data can be aggregated together to provide more of a focus on accurate service data- benefiting partners, staff, and residents alike. Most importantly, it enables a truly 'no wrong door' approach, making it easier for citizens to access the services they need, no matter where they first seek help.
