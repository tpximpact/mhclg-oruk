# Government and community involvement

ORUK is important for efficient sharing of services data across Government and community organisations. Examples of relevant activities beyond local government are:

- social prescribing in health
- family services relevant to education
- helping with work readiness
- debt advice in relation to tax and benefits
- community groups to reduce social isolation

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) runs the Cross Government Steering Group for ORUK to encourage collaboration between local government and other sectors, following these [Terms of Reference](/steering/ORUK%20Steering%20Group%20-%20Terms%20of%20Reference.pdf). As of March 2025, the Group includes members from the following organisations:

- MHCLG
- NHS standards
- Department for Education
- Central Digital and Data Office
- Local Government Association
- Community and voluntary sector
- Department for Work and Pensions
- Department for Science, Innovation and Technology
