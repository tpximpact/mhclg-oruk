# International Open Referral data standard

The standard is rooted in open data standard principles which is part of the remit of the Local Digital Declaration,
but the standard itself originates in the US and builds on the work done there since 2014.
The specific focus of the Open Referral data standard was to set up a standard for local directories using community services data.

The international standard is described at the [Open Referral website](https://openreferral.org/).

Examples of US programmes using the standard to structure their service information:

- [North Carolina](https://www.unitedwaync.org/) Department of Health and Human Services implemented an interoperable resource directory to match clients to health care providers, community-based organisations, and public services
- [District of Columbia Primary Care Association](http://dcpca.org/) is using Open Referral to help understand how to build infrastructure that supports coordinated screening, referral and tracking across a range of health, human, and social services
- [Hunger Free America](https://www.hungerfreeamerica.org/) publishes printed guides to help people get free food in New York City and operates a National Hunger Hotline
- [Bay Area Community](https://www.bayareacommunity.org/#/) provides information on food programmes, legal aid, mental health, domestic violence support, housing, benefits, and more during the COVID-19 pandemic
