# Accessibility statement for Open Referral UK

This statement applies to content published on the [https://openreferraluk.org](/) domain.

Our project is very much about technology bringing people and organisations together, so accesibilty is core to everything we do.

## Compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2)

We believe this website meets all criteria for Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2), globally recognised as the state of the art, and mandated by UK government best practice.

## Continuous Testing

We recognize the importance of automated accessibility checking tools in ensuring the accessibility of our website. That's why we continuously test our website using the Axe accessibility testing platform. Every component has been undercontinuous test from the moment it first landed on the page. However, we understand that accessibility goes beyond just automated tools, which is why we made it a priority to integrate accessibility considerations into every design decision we have made.

## Ongoing Commitment

Accessibility isn't a destination, it's a journey. We believe in continually challenging ourselves with the latest best practice and the most up to date techniques... but we're also aware that accesibility also invloves trade offs. If you feel there's areas where we could up our game, we would love to hear from you/ ==. If you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions regarding the accessibility of our site, or if you encounter any barriers, please don't hesitate to contact our Accessibility Manager at [Contact Information].

As a community ORUK believes that inclusivity is essential to building a stronger and more connected world. Your feedback is vital in helping us make sure that everyone can access and benefit from our content.

Thank you for helping us make ORUK a more inclusive space for all!
