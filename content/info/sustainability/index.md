# Sustainability policy

At ORUK, we are committed to sustainability in every aspect of our website design. We recognize that sustainability best practices are continually evolving, and we strive to stay ahead of these changes. Our design focuses on minimizing environmental impact by ensuring our website is optimized for low bandwidth and maximum compatibility. By using lightweight technologies like SVG graphics, we reduce data usage and energy consumption, making our site more efficient and accessible for all users, regardless of their connection speed. We are dedicated to ongoing improvements to align with emerging sustainability standards
