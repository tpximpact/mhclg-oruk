# Verified feed availability

View organisations and suppliers who have successfully implemented compliant ORUK data feeds. This resource provides assurance that your peers are using trusted, interoperable standards, putting you in good company.

## About compliance

This tool helps you quickly assess your service data feed's status and performance. It provides near real-time feedback on service availability and quality, helping you understand if the service is available now.

## Your service directory health check

Developers can track and manage the compliance of their service data feeds with the ORUK standard. You can see how well your directory meets the standard, monitor service availability, and get insights into the quality of the data. To reduce load on the servers, these data will be updated once a day.
