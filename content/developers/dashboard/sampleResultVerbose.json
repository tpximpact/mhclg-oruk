Social support assessments to people who have been diagnosed by our team.

We currently accept referrals for people within Bristol, North Somerset, BANES and South Gloucestershire. We run advice services for adults with autism diagnoses in Bristol, Bath, South Gloucestershire and North Somerset. Bristol&nbsp;autism advice service runs every Friday from 12.30 - 4.30pm at the Create Centre, Spike Island. It is open to people with autism spectrum conditions who live in the area.
