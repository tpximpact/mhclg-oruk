# Understanding data sharing and privacy

Open Referral UK (ORUK) is an open standard for the sharing of open data, making service directories more accessible and easier to reuse.

## Data you can share

In line with the ethos of open data and the [Local Digital Declaration](https://openreferraluk.org/about-standard#section-4-heading), most data in a
service directory should be open and available for reuse under an:

- Open Government Licence, or
- equivalent that allows free use for any legal (commercial or non-commercial use) purpose.

Data in most council directories is public - the ORUK standard makes reuse of this public information easier.

## Data you must keep private

Data you should not expose in your ORUK data feed includes:

- **Internal services** - information about services that are exclusively for internal use and are not available to people outside your organisation
- **Archived records** - remove all data records that are no longer live, or clearly indicate that they are inactive
- **Sensitive information** - it is crucial to protect fields that should not be made public because of privacy or ethical reasons
  (for example the location of a refuge) and other sensitive service contexts
- **Personal contact information** - such as details for the person responsible for updating the record, or contact information for staff that is
  only intended to be shared among specific partners
