# Open Referral UK data feed dashboard

**About compliance**

The ORUK Dashboard helps you quickly assess your service directory’s status and performance. It provides near real-time feedback on service availability and quality, helping you understand if the service is available now.

**Your service directory health check**

 This dashboard allows developers to track and manage the compliance of their service directory with the Open Referral UK standard. You can see how well your directory meets the standard, monitor service availability, and get insights into the quality of the data.

**How it works**

* View live data[LINK TO DIRECTORY] on whether your services are available now.
* Get real-time feedback [LINK TO VALIDATOR] on how well your service directory complies with the ORUK standard.
* See which types of data are included in your service directory.
