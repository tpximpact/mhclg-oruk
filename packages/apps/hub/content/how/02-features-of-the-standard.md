# Features of the standard

The Open Referral UK standard defines a comprehensive range of information that can be recorded for each service.

The minimum information needed for a service is:

- name of service
- unique identifier
- name of service provider that runs the service

## Service information categories

## Organisation - the service provider

Every service is linked to a service provider.

You can include a:

- description
- logo
- web link
- unique identifier from Companies House or the Charity Commission (if available)

Most information is recorded about individual services, not the service provider responsible. The distinction between service and service provider (organisation) is important.

##Service

The ‘service’ is the main piece of information to which most attributes belong.
As well as its name and identifier, a service can have:
a description
web links
details of how it is delivered, such as
online
by phone
in person by referral, appointment or drop-in
The date that service information was last assured is recorded to allow you to apply quality checks and filters.
Contacts
Multiple contacts can be recorded for an organisation and you can denote the languages spoken.
Eligibility
The standard lets you record eligibility criteria for a service related to the service user and their location. You can log eligibility criteria such as gender, age and benefits status.
Location eligibility defines where users need to live to use a service. If you specify a service area you can add then add criteria, for example that someone must live in a particular borough to gain access to a service.
Location
The locations at which a service is delivered are recorded so service users know where to attend and the information can be shown on a map.
Accessibility
Accessibility information is recorded for service locations.
Schedule
Each service can have a regular schedule. You can configure the frequency of the service, the days of the week and the times.
Taxonomy
The standard allows for taxonomy terms to be recorded against services, eligibility criteria and many other types of service attribute.
By using taxonomy terms from shared open taxonomies you make your data easier to understand and it can be combined with other people’s.
Cost
Service cost information can be recorded for different time periods and options.
Review
Service reviews are used to denote where official bodies have reviewed a service and provided a rating.
For example, OFSTED might have provided an ‘excellent’ rating or a specific council might have provided an ‘inspection passed’ rating. Having access to ratings means frontline workers can make a more informed decision as to whether they want to recommend a service to people.
